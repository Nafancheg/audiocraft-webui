## Model & Output Licensing Disclaimer

This document supplements the root `LICENSE` (Unlicense) which applies ONLY to the application code in this repository.

### 1. Code vs. Models
- Code: Public domain (Unlicense). Use, modify, redistribute without restriction.
- Models: Pre-trained weights (e.g. MusicGen, MultiBandDiffusion) are third-party artifacts with their own licenses ("Upstream Licenses"). They may impose: attribution duties, commercial use limits, acceptable use / safety rules, export or region constraints.

### 2. Generated Audio ("Outputs")
Outputs created via the UI can inherit restrictions from the model license. Before commercializing, publishing, syncing, or sublicensing any Output, confirm:
1. The model license allows your intended use case (commercial, derivative, etc.).
2. You are not infringing third-party IP (melodies, performances, trademarks).
3. You meet attribution or notice obligations (if any).

### 3. No Rights to Training Data
You receive NO rights to any underlying training datasets. Similarity of an Output to an existing work does not grant permission to exploit that work.

### 4. Derivative / Fine-Tuned Models
If you fine-tune or adapt the weights:
- Retain required notices / license files.
- Respect any redistribution caps or non-commercial clauses.
- Clearly label derivative provenance if mandated.

### 5. Risk & Compliance
You assume full responsibility for:
- Rights clearance (composers, publishers, performers, neighboring rights where applicable).
- Content compliance (no unlawful, hateful, infringing, or privacy-violating use).
- Local law (collective management, moral rights, export controls, etc.).

### 6. Suggested Attribution Template
```
Audio generated with Meta Audiocraft (MusicGen) via the audiocraft-webui interface.
```
Add additional attributions required by specific weights or add-on models you employ.

### 7. Removal / Changes Upstream
If an upstream provider changes license terms or revokes distribution, you must abide by the new terms. This UI does not automatically enforce such changes.

### 8. No Warranty / No Indemnity
Both the code (Unlicense) and any third-party models are provided AS IS. There is no warranty of originality of Outputs. Perform independent legal review for commercial exploitation.

---
For precise obligations, always read the official upstream repository licenses (e.g. Meta Audiocraft). When in doubt, consult legal counsel.
